parameters:
  probabilistic: True # use probabilistic SVD algorithm (maybe fastest but little inaccurate) instead of the non probabilistic SVD algorithm (slowest but accurate)
  sv_reduction: 0.33 # strict value: "1.0 / number of task vector" or less (never more), if number of task vector is >=2 (percentage of singular components to keep for each TV)
  num_iterations: 4 # number of iterations for the probabilistic SVD algorithm (2 is a good start and fastest option but could be inaccurate, 32 is the most accurate but slowest option. I don't recommend going above 32 use SVD probabilistic at False instead)
